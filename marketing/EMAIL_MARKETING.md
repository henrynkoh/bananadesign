**Subject:** "Your First Design in 3 Simple Steps"

---

Hi [First Name],

Ready to create your first design? It's easier than you think! Here's a simple 3-step guide:

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Floor Plan

You don't need a professional floor plan. Any of these work:
- ✅ Scanned drawing
- ✅ Digital floor plan
- ✅ Hand-drawn sketch (if clear)
- ✅ Real estate listing floor plan
- ✅ Any image showing your space layout

**Tip:** Use a clear, high-contrast image for best results.

**👉 [Upload Your Floor Plan →](your-website-url)**

---

## Step 2: Write Your Prompt

Don't overthink it! Start simple:

**Beginner-Friendly Prompts:**
- "Modern minimalist living room"
- "Cozy Scandinavian design"
- "Luxury contemporary style"

**Want More Detail?** Add colors, materials, or mood:
- "Modern minimalist living room with white walls, light gray sofa, and natural light"

**👉 [Try It Now →](your-website-url)**

---

## Step 3: Generate & Explore

Click send and wait 60 seconds. That's it!

Then:
- Review your design
- Try a different style
- Refine your prompt
- Generate again

**The more you experiment, the better you'll get!**

**👉 [Create Your Design →](your-website-url)**

Hi [First Name],

Ready to take your designs to the next level? Today, we're sharing advanced prompt writing techniques used by professional designers:

## Technique 1: Layered Descriptions

Start broad, then add layers of detail:

**Layer 1:** Style
"Modern living room"

"Modern living room with white walls and light oak floors"

**Layer 3:** Furniture
"Modern living room with white walls, light oak floors, gray sofa, and wood coffee table"

## Technique 2: Room-Specific Focus

Mention specific rooms for better results:

- "Focus on the kitchen with modern appliances"
- "Design a luxurious master bedroom"
- "Create a cozy reading nook in the corner"

Room-specific prompts help the AI understand spatial priorities.

**👉 [Try Room-Specific Prompts →](your-website-url)**

## Technique 3: Negative Prompts

Tell the AI what to avoid:

"Modern living room with neutral colors. Avoid dark furniture, avoid cluttered spaces, avoid heavy curtains."

This helps refine your design and eliminate unwanted elements.

**👉 [Try Negative Prompts →](your-website-url)**

---

## Technique 4: Style Combinations

Combine styles for unique results:

- "Modern with Scandinavian influences"
- "Traditional with contemporary accents"
- "Industrial meets minimalist"

**👉 [Try Style Combinations →](your-website-url)**
