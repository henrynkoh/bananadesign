1. In the chat input, type: "Cozy Scandinavian design with white walls, light wood floors, soft textiles, green plants, and warm natural lighting"
2. Review the prompt
3. Click Send

**Wait for Generation:**
- Allow 30-60 seconds
- Observe the generation process

**Review Scandinavian Result:**
- Notice the light, airy feel
- Observe natural wood elements
- Check for plant inclusion
- Evaluate the cozy atmosphere
- Compare to your first modern design

### Step 3: Generate Luxury Design

2. Send the prompt

**Review Industrial Result:**
- Check for industrial elements
- Notice material textures
- Observe color scheme
- Evaluate the urban feel

### Step 5: Compare All Results

**Side-by-Side Comparison:**
- Review all three generated designs
- Note the differences in:
  - Color palettes
  - Furniture styles
  - Material choices
  - Overall mood
  - Lighting approaches

**Key Learnings:**
- Same floor plan, different styles
- Prompt specificity matters
- Style names are powerful
- Material mentions help
- Mood descriptions influence results

### Step 6: Download Your Favorites

**Select Best Designs:**
- Choose your favorite style
- Download the image
- Save others if desired
- Organize in a folder

**Naming Convention:**
- `scandinavian-design.png`
- `luxury-design.png`
- `industrial-design.png`
- Or use descriptive names

### Reflection

**What You Learned:**
- How to write style-specific prompts
- The impact of style descriptions
- Material and color importance
- How to compare different approaches

**Next Steps:**
You're ready to create more detailed, customized designs. Let's move to Tutorial 3.

## Tutorial 3: Detailed Custom Design

### Objective

Create a highly detailed, customized interior design by writing comprehensive prompts with specific requirements.

### Step 1: Prepare a Detailed Vision

**Before Writing Your Prompt, Consider:**
- Overall style preference
- Specific color scheme
- Furniture types needed
- Lighting preferences
- Material choices
- Mood or atmosphere
- Special features

**Example Vision:**
"I want a modern Scandinavian living room with:
- White walls and light oak floors
- A large comfortable sofa in light gray
- Natural wood coffee table
- Plants throughout
- Large windows with natural light
- Cozy reading corner
- Minimalist but warm"

### Step 2: Write a Comprehensive Prompt

**Structure Your Prompt:**

**Basic Structure:**
1. Style name
2. Color scheme
3. Materials
4. Furniture
5. Lighting
6. Special features
7. Mood

**Example Detailed Prompt:**
"Modern Scandinavian living room with white walls and light oak hardwood floors. Include a large comfortable light gray sofa, natural wood coffee table, and several green plants. Large windows provide abundant natural light. Add a cozy reading corner with a comfortable armchair and floor lamp. The style should be minimalist but warm and inviting, with soft textiles and natural materials throughout."

**Why This Works:**
- Specific style mentioned
- Colors explicitly stated
- Materials detailed
- Furniture described
- Lighting specified
- Mood included
- Room type clear

### Step 3: Upload and Generate

**Process:**
1. Ensure floor plan is uploaded
2. Paste or type your detailed prompt
3. Review for completeness
4. Send the prompt
5. Wait for generation

### Step 4: Analyze the Detailed Result

**Check Each Element:**
- ✓ White walls present?
- ✓ Light wood floors visible?
- ✓ Gray sofa included?
- ✓ Wood coffee table?
- ✓ Plants visible?
- ✓ Natural light apparent?
- ✓ Reading corner present?
- ✓ Minimalist but warm feel?

**Detailed Analysis:**
- Which elements appeared as described?
- Which elements need refinement?
- What exceeded expectations?
- What's missing or different?

### Step 5: Refine and Regenerate

**If Results Need Improvement:**

**Identify Issues:**
- Missing elements
- Wrong colors
- Incorrect style
- Unwanted features

**Create Refined Prompt:**
Add more specificity to address issues:

"Modern Scandinavian living room with pure white walls (not off-white) and light natural oak hardwood floors. Must include a large light gray fabric sofa, a natural wood coffee table with clean lines, and at least 5-6 green plants including a large floor plant. Large windows with white curtains allow natural light. Include a dedicated reading corner with a comfortable light-colored armchair, a floor lamp, and a small side table. The overall style is minimalist Scandinavian - clean lines, natural materials, but warm and cozy with soft textiles like throw pillows and a area rug. Avoid dark colors and heavy furniture."

**Generate Again:**
- Send refined prompt
- Compare to first result
- Note improvements

### Step 6: Document Your Process

**Keep Notes:**
- What worked in your prompt
- What didn't work
- How refinements helped
- Best practices discovered

**Build Your Prompt Library:**
- Save effective prompts
- Note what works for your style
- Create templates
- Build vocabulary

### Key Takeaways

**Detailed Prompts Yield Better Results:**
- More specific = more accurate
- Multiple elements = comprehensive designs
- Material mentions = realistic textures
- Mood descriptions = appropriate atmosphere

**Practice Makes Perfect:**
- Each generation teaches you something
- Refinement is part of the process
- Don't expect perfection first try
- Iteration improves outcomes

### The Iteration Process

**Step 1: Generate Initial Design**

**Start with Basic Prompt:**
"Modern living room with neutral colors"

**Generate and Review:**
- What works?
- What's missing?
- What's wrong?
- What needs change?

**Step 2: Identify Improvement Areas**

**Common Areas:**

**Add Specificity:**
"Modern living room with white walls, light gray sofa, natural wood coffee table, and neutral color palette. Include large windows with natural light."

**Generate Again:**
- Compare to first result
- Note improvements
- Identify remaining issues

**Step 4: Further Refinement**

**Even More Specific:**
"Modern minimalist living room with pure white walls (not cream), a large light gray fabric sectional sofa, a natural oak wood coffee table with clean lines, light hardwood floors, large windows with white curtains allowing natural light, and a few green plants. The style is minimalist but warm, avoiding dark colors."

**Generate Third Time:**
- Compare all three results
- Track improvements
- Note what worked

### Advanced Refinement Techniques

**Technique 1: Element Isolation**

**Focus on One Element:**

- Third iteration: Refine colors
- Fourth iteration: Adjust lighting

**Technique 2: Comparative Testing**

**Test Variations:**
- Generate with "modern"
- Generate with "contemporary"
- Generate with "minimalist modern"
- Compare and choose best

**Technique 3: Negative Prompts**

**Specify What to Avoid:**
"Modern living room with neutral colors. Avoid dark furniture, avoid cluttered spaces, avoid heavy curtains."

### Real-World Example: Complete Iteration

**Iteration 1: Basic**
Prompt: "Modern living room"
Result: Generic modern room, some issues

**Iteration 2: Add Style Details**
Prompt: "Modern Scandinavian living room with light colors"
Result: Better style, still needs specifics

**Iteration 3: Add Furniture**
Prompt: "Modern Scandinavian living room with white walls, light wood floors, gray sofa, wood coffee table"
Result: Good furniture, needs lighting

**Iteration 4: Complete Design**
Prompt: "Modern Scandinavian living room with white walls, light oak floors, large light gray sofa, natural wood coffee table, large windows with natural light, green plants, and minimalist warm style"
Result: Comprehensive, polished design
